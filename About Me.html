          <em>Moby-Dick</em></a>
          by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago–never mind how long
          precisely–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
          particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
          little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of
          driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you),
        Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one
        jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who—<em>spoiler
        alert!</em>—is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
